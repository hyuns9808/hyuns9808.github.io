Hi! Welcome to hyuns9808.github.io, a personal website of Calvin Yang / 양현수.

## A little bit about myself...

I am currently an undergraduate student at Georgia Tech studying Computer Science. My main field of interest is Cybersecurity, specifically ML based AI that could be utilized to analyze potential risks within networks and also automatically analyze incoming cyberattacks and reinforce potential weakpoints according to the weakpoints and attacking patterns.

## So what is this website for?

It's basically a website for me to organize my current work and portfolio. During my albiet short time at Tech, I noticed that it would be very easy for me to lose focus on what I really want to do(mainly because there are just so many fun things to study), so I felt the need to organize my work and keep my momentum. This site was created exactly for that purpose; and also for potential employers(wink wink) to easily visualize my work and passion for the field.

## How it was created

This site was built based on Chirpy, a Jekyll theme, and Github Pages. I gave additional tweaks to the HTML/JavaScript files accordingly.
